CSC214: Mobile App Development

Academic Honestly Pledge:

“I affirm that I did not give or receive any unauthorized help on this project, and that all work will is my own.”

App Purpose:
The purpose of this app is to give students a tool to organize their study plan throughout the four+ years of college. 

Target Audience:
Anyone going through a 5-year (or less) college program. The targeted user is looking for a tool that makes it easier to organize their study plan.

Why:
There is no other app like this in the market right now. This app will start being UofR specific but I plan on pushing it to be able to use it for many other schools. Right now the Computer Science department has a similar tool but this app would expand its use to every single other major.  

Future Plan:
This app will develop to include difference Major Requirements and links to webpages from the school’s server. I want to add a little more color to the app, it look very boring at the moment. I wanna be able to let users create their own profiles so that the information in their app is unique to them. 

Enhancements from Project 2:

1) Added Home Screen: Uses Stack view for different buttons that direct you to different functionalities
2)
