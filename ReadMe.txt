How to use the App:

There are 4 buttons in the home screen: 
	1) My Four Year Plan: This will take you to a list of your semesters of college. Then clicking any semester will bring you to the list of classes that you have assigned to that semester. If you click on the add button (+), it will take you to a list of all the courses that have been added to the apps core data. You can then select any course that you want to add to your semester.
	2) Adding new Courses: The big + in the home screen will show a pop-up where you can fill the info to add a new course. This pop up can also be accessed through the complete list of courses when adding to each semester with the small + in the top right of the screen.
	3) CDCS button: This functionality will take you to the CDCS website with a WebView. 
	4) “Try Image”: This functionality will take you to another View where you can try Image Fetching. Here you can insert a link to an image online and it will be displayed in the image view.
